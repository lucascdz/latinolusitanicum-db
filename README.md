# latinolusitanicum-db
## a database from legacy Latin-Portuguese dictionaries

This repository contains lexicographic data (expressed as RDF triples) of Latin-Portuguese legacy dictionaries modeled using the Ontolex/Lexicog ontologies and linked to the LiLa knowledge base.
The data are also available as a set of relational tables in TSV format, where each table contains data related to an Ontolex/Lexicog class.

## Contents
Each dictionary is published as a single RDF turtle file (named 'Author.ttl').
